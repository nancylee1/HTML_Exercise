        ," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a beautiful game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a <em>beautiful</em> smile. "Why

            <h2>Korean Food Tours</h2>
            <div>
              <p>I offer customized food tours by request. My experiences are progressive meals that are focused on 
                traditional markets, artisan products and local chefs. As I get to know my guests, I will change up 
                the itinerary on the fly to fit certain requests, dietary restrictions and other factors. I offer 
                lunch or dinner tours and exploratory tours for hospitality and food professionals that are looking 
                for a deep dive into Korean cuisine.</p>&nbsp;

            <h2>Korean-style 9Anime and Chill</h2>
            <p>Shin Ramen and Kimchi is how we do it in Korea. I have learned how to make Ramen with nearly no sound 
              like a <em>ninja</em>. I like to add an egg in it just as the ramen starts to bubble. The kimchi is a perfect 
              complement. Hey it might not be the healthiest but it is my comfort food that goes well with a side of 
              Overlord.</p>&nbsp;

              <h3>The Importance of Color</h3>
              <p>I love how colorful Korea is. If you look out at any busy street, there are myriads of shades. 
                This is a recent picture I took at Mercentopolis at Hapjeong Station at nighttime. The umbrellas 
                just set the right mood for an evening with friends or family. </p>&nbsp;
